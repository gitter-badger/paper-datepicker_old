This is an extension of the Paper Input or Paper Button component with the Custom Component [Paper Calendar](https://github.com/Wenqer/paper-calendar/blob/master/paper-calendar.html) by [Wenqer](https://github.com/Wenqer) using (Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment).
We have used for this example the Paper Button. All this using the Paper Full Screen Dialog experience of dominating a page so only one decision can be made.

We are trying to use the styling from the Polymer Demo calculator for the dates.
